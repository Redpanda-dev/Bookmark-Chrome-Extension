# Youtube Bookmark Extension

> [!NOTE]
> This is a hobby project.

A YouTube video bookmarker. The idea is to create bookmarks for watched videos and save these bookmarks using `chrome.storage`.

### Example of Use:

#### When viewing a page that is not a YouTube page, we see this:
![Non-Youtube page image](Screenshots/Not-An-YouTube-Page.png)

#### A simple button added to the control panel of the video (HTML manipulation):
![Added plus sign](Screenshots/plus-sign-in-an-video.png)

#### After adding the bookmarks and clicking the bookmark list (while on the video page), the video bookmarks are visible. You can edit ("edit" mode is under construction for now) and remove the bookmarks here:

#### Empty bookmark list in a video:

#### When there are saved bookmarks and you are on the main page of YouTube, you can see the videos to which you have added bookmarks. By clicking the bookmark it takes you to the video.

#### When there are no bookmarks saved (but you are on YouTube main page):
